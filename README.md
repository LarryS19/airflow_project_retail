# airflow_project_retail
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform which is used for orchestrating and automating workflows and data pipelines. It helps data professionals to programmatically author, schedule, monitor and manage workflows. A package which is perfect for tasks such as extracting, transforming and loading data into dashboards.

In this example we will be using a transnational retail   [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/online-retail){:target="_blank"} from a UK-based e-commerce site. The data will be extracted from a csv file and loaded into a google cloud storage, will be passed through several data quality checks, shaped with DBT and finally loaded into a dashboard using Metabase. 

Please visit my blog for a more detailed look at the project!
